# TekkenGame_SkinEmulation_4.13.2
An emulation for Tekken Skin Material for modding purpose, made for the new custom engine based on 4.13.2

There is no guarantee that it will also work with old custom engine, which was based on pre4.14

You can get the newly fixed and clean engine right here https://github.com/Modding-Zaibatsu/ue4-tekkengame

Full release with all material instances can be found in Release page. 

Only needed MasterMaterials? You can also download from the source code instead!
